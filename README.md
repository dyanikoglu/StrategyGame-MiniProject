![Game Screenshot](https://image.ibb.co/m3Fubd/Screenshot.png)

A pseudo 2D strategy game developed with **pure MVC pattern** in Unity.

## Features
- Camera can be dragged by holding down **Mouse Left Button**.

- Left panel can be scrolled down infinitely.

- Soldiers are using A* pathfinding algorithm. Pathfinding behaviour can be optimized from **model** object on scene.

- Barracks can spawn unlimited amount of soldiers if **EdgeLength** variable in model object is set to a big value. Spawned soldiers won't overlap other items on map.
